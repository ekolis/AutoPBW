AutoPBW is a desktop client for [PBW](http://pbw.spaceempires.net) used to upload and download game files for Space Empires and other turn-based strategy games supported by the website. It's a (hopefully more user friendly) replacement for both SJ's autohost and se5a's autoclient

Features:

* Download turns (.gam files) from PBW and launch games immediately or later
* Upload turns (.plr files) to PBW
* Automatically process turns for games you host or have been invited as a guest autohost user
* Minimize to system tray with notifications when new turns are ready
* Go straight to the PBW website with one click
* Preconfigured with settings for a variety of commonly used game engines and mods (you'll need to manually configure any others you want to use)

AutoPBW requires Windows Vista/7+ or later to run due to using the latest .NET Framework.
